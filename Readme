Please refer to the insturctions below to produce results for this assignment.

1. I did not follow the provided template.

2. I made a new one and used data structures such as cell etc.

3. Go to main.m and select 'dataSet' variable 1 for Default dataset and 2 for my own dataset

4. Set ‘highRes’ variable in the main.m to 1 to view extremely high-resolution images. 
(Warning: This will take 20 to 30 minutes to run, but you can do this reproduce figure in this report.).  

5. By default, the flag is set to 0 so that the code runs in 2 minutes but the results will
not be as high quality as the report.

6. Please use the matlab figure to visualize the results instead of the mesh lab

7. Figure files have also been saved in the current directory to visualize without running the high 
resolution version
 File Name : 
  (i). two View : "twoview.fig" for your dataset, and "twoview2.fig" for my data set
   (ii). Growing step: "finalGrowingStep1.fig" for your dataset, "finalGrowingStep2.fig" for my data set
    (iii).Also have a look at SFM1.png and SFM2.png for growing step with your dataset

8. You might need to mex the function for 5 point algorithm again on your computer 

9. Finally to run Bundle Adjustment for two view, set 'optim' variable to 1. By deafult it will be 0.

Thank you.
